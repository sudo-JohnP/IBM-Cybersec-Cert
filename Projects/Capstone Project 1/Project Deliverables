Below are the Project Deliverables

  Including:
    - Data Security Posture Form with compliance checklist and suggestions
    - Backup Plan
    - Data Encryption suggestions


**Data Security Posture Form**

Compliance with HIPAA Security Rule:
- Reasonable and Appropriate Safeguards
- CIA of e-PHI


**Backup Plan**

Backup Responsibility:
  The Information Technology team lead will be responsible for overseeing the backup process, ensuring that all backups are completed. This team lead will
  also be responsible as updating backup policies/procedures as the organization changes over time. 
Backup Locations:
  Following the 3-2-1 rule to ensure accessibility, recoverability, and resilience of data, three backup locations will be used. Two of these will be on-site;
  a hard disk drive backup and a local storage server. The third will be an off-site cloud storage backuo. 
Backup Frequency:
  Full backups will occur every Sunday at 5pm and differential backups will take place daily at 5pm. These differential backups capture all changes between
  the time of the backup and the previous backup. This allows for easier, quicker, backups, while also putting less of a load on storage by capturing smaller
  amounts of data at a time throughout the week. 
Backup Security Measures:
  All backups will be encrypted with symmetric encryption. Cloud backups will be protected with end-to-end encryption. Employees will need to use MFA to access
  backups. Backup access will also be limited using RBAC. 
Review and Documentation:
  Backup processes will be reviewed by IT team lead quarterly to ensure all processes are up to date and in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Additionally,
  all backups must be documented, detailing when backups took place and what data was backed up. 


**Data Encryption Suggestions**

On-site systems:
  The example Healthcare Provider has main computers, used on-site for all data entry and storage. Full disk encryption (FDE) should be used to encrypt
  these systems in whole, protecting all data at rest and preventing unauthorized access to stored data or adjacent systems. FDE encrypts data at rest 
  so it is useful for encrypting systems in whole, however, other encryption methods will need to be used to encrypt files while systems are running. 
Emails:
  Asymetric encryption should be used for sending sensitive data via email. Although it is less efficient, asymetric encryption is more secure
  than symmetric encryption. With asymmetric encryption, private keys don't have to be shared, eliminating risks for things such as man-in-the-middle
  interception attacks. 
Backing up files
  When backing up data files as systems are running, symmetric encryption should be used. Symmetric encryption allows for the encryption of in-transit
  data. Symmetric encryption is very fast and efficient so it will allow for operations to continue running as normal, while protecting sensitive data.
