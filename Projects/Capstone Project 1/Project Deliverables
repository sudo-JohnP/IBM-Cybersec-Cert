Below are the Project Deliverables

  Including:
    - Data Security Posture Form with compliance checklist and suggestions
    - Backup Plan
    - Data Encryption suggestions


**Data Security Posture Form**

-


**Backup Plan**

Backup Locations:
  Following the 3-2-1 rule to ensure accessibility, recovery, and resilience of data, three backup locations will be used. Two of these will be on-site;
  a hard disk drive backup and a . 

- 3-2-1 rule
- 3 backups, 2 onsite, 1 offsite
- Local storage backup and hard disk drive backup on site
- offsite cloud backup
- daily differential backups to backup new data while staying efficient with resources
- IT Team Lead will be responsible for backups


**Data Encryption Suggestions**

On-site systems:
  The example Healthcare Provider has main computers, used on-site for all data entry and storage. Full disk encryption (FDE) should be used to encrypt
  these systems in whole, protecting all data at rest and preventing unauthorized access to stored data or adjacent systems. FDE encrypts data at rest 
  so it is useful for encrypting systems in whole, however, other encryption methods will need to be used to encrypt files while systems are running. 
Emails:
  Asymetric encryption should be used for sending sensitive data via email. Although it is less efficient, asymetric encryption is more secure
  than symmetric encryption. With asymmetric encryption, private keys don't have to be shared, eliminating risks for things such as man-in-the-middle
  interception attacks. 
Backing up files
  When backing up data files as systems are running, symmetric encryption should be used. Symmetric encryption allows for the encryption of in-transit
  data. Symmetric encryption is very fast and efficient so it will allow for operations to continue running as normal, while protecting sensitive data.
