**Perform Impact Analysis to Address Vulnerabilities**

In this capstone project, I will perform an impact analysis to address vulnerabilities for a sample small publishing company in DC.
The two goals of this project are
  1. Identify vulnerabilities that the company has
  2. Apply appropriate threat mitigation tactics to address these vulnerabilities


Learning objectives, after completing this capstone project, I will be able to: 

Evaluate the current state of organizational security
Analyze the impact of cybersecurity threats on systems and process
Categorize vulnerabilities by severity to prioritize controls
Justify threat mitigation tactics
