***Administrative Control Plan for Compliance***

Training Plan for a tech startup:

Cybersecurity onboarding training:
Employees will be required to attend 3 cybersecurity trainings in their onboarding week. The first onboarding training will cover requirements for MFA and 
password policies. The second training will cover phishing and similar threats and best practices to help avoid accidents; including proper reporting
procedures. The third training will cover secure practices for remote workers such as VPN configuration, guidelines, and MDM. 

Additional training frequencies:
Employees will periodically receive simulated phishing emails and if employees fall for the bait they'llbe required to go through training immediately. All
employees must renew their training annually. In addition to the annual training, employees will be required to watch a short, 15-minute video reviewing annual
training topics every 3 months. 

Informing employees of emerging cyberthreats:
To keep employees informed of cyberthreats, there will be a monthly cybersecurity news letter sent to employees. If it is urgent that employees are informed 
about a new cyberthreat, an immediate email will be sent along with a meeting being set up.
