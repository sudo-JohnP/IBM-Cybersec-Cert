Activity -- Create a Risk Assessment
  -- the guided steps will be provided 

Imagine that you’re starting a new job as a cybersecurity expert for a tech company headquartered in South Florida. The headquarters is on a 
main boulevard near the beach. This building contains servers for storing backups. Employees use company computers and wifi for network access. 
Your supervisor tasks you with completing a risk assessment for the company. To start, you’ll determine the risks. 

Step 1
Identify the company’s external and internal risks. As you work to identify risks, think of the following
questions:
  • What external risks might the company face given the location of the servers and company
    headquarters?
  • What internal risks might the company face with employees working remotely and at
    headquarters?
Explain why the company should consider each risk that you identify.

Step 2
Describe one consequence or impact for each risk you identified in Step 1. Explain how each risk can
lead to the impact described.

Step 3
Determine the tolerability of the risks that you identified in Step 1. Perform the following tasks for each
risk:
  • Rate your company’s tolerance for each risk using the system discussed before: low, moderate,
    high, or very high.
  • Describe the risk’s frequency and the extent of the harm that it can cause.
  • Explain why you rated the risk low, moderate, high, or very high.
