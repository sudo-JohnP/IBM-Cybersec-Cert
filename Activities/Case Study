Synnovis Ransomware Attack Case Study
Reflection on the impacts of the cybersecurity incident:

The ransomware attacks on the Synnovis IT infrastructure had both short and long-term effects. In the short-term, the pathology department experienced technical
drawbacks, being unable to view essential records and blocking communications with the NHS. This prevented them from processing blood tests. In the long-term,
this ransomware attack led to increased security measures, and has influenced other healthcare providers to take proactive security approaches. Things like
constant network monitoring, secure identity systems, and response/backout plans in case of incidents have become more popular in the healthcare industry. 

Although the ransomware attack was highly problematic for the healthcare provider, Synnovis, its effects spread beyond the organization as well. Within the 
organization, employee workloads were increased as employees were forced to find work-arounds to continue operations. The organization also dealt with financial
losses, an unanticipated resource allocation towards the incident, and a damaged reputation. This story was covered heavily by media, putting Synnovis in a poor

dangerous and even life-threatening.
