Activity -- Create a sample backup plan
  -- the guided steps will be provided 

Guided Steps:
Step 1
  Imagine that you’re working in the IT department for a large retail franchise and have a team of 20 experts. Your supervisor tasks you with developing a backup plan. 
  Identify the person, team, or device that will complete backups. For this activity, you have three choices:
    • Store manager
    • IT team
    • Automated backup system
Step 2
  Identify the types of data that the company should back up. Your answer must include one or more of the
  following types:
    • Employee records
    • Financial records
    • Customer data
    • Business documentation
    • Intellectual property
    • System data
Step 3
  Identify the type of daily backup that your company should perform:
    • Full
    • Differential
    • IncrementalStep 3
Step 4
  Use the 3-2-1 rule to identify where your company should store its backups.
  Which types of storage will you use, and where will backups be located?
Step 5
  Determine when your company should perform backups: daily, weekly, or a combination of both.

***Full Backup Plan Response:

Who should complete the backups:
  In this scenario, I would suggest an automated backup system, considering the IT expertise available to implement and troubleshoot. An automated process would
  be ideal for a large firm from a time commitment standpoint. The IT team would need to dedicate a member or group to check the system. Since backups are important
  and need to be constantly happening in a large firm, they should verify backups every 3-5 minutes. However, this verification process should be automated with an
  alert feature for when backups are not happening correctly.

Types of data that should be backed up and an example of each:
  - Employee records -- Employee contracts and PII should be backed up; legal protections
  - Financial records -- Any tax and accounting related data should be backed up; for backtracking purposes
  - Customer records -- Customer feedback should be backed up; can be looked back on for progress/reflection purposes
  - Business documentation -- Inventory reports should be backed up; used to support supply chain managers
  - IP -- Should always be backed up; can be essential to business operations; can be necessary for lawsuit
  - System data -- Must backup configuration data, updates, etc; necessary to support IT troubleshooting efforts

Type of backup recommended:
  Since this is a large retail company I would suggest a combination of full and incremental backups. Having full backups once a week, maybe on Sundays and then
  incremental backups throughout the week. This would allow for smooth operations throughout the week and still support quicker recovery by having weekly full
  backups.
