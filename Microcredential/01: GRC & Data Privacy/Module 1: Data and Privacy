Notes for Module 1: Data and Privacy

Learning Objectives... Be able to:
  - Determine ways the 3 key elements of cybersec apply to common tasks
  - Categorize sensitive data types
  - Apply CIA Triad to real-world situations
  - Apply file and drive encryption
  - Develop a backup plan

3 Key Elements of Cybersecurity:
  - People -- Security measures are only as good as the people they protect! Training is key to ensure people practice safe habits
  - Processes -- Standard Operating Procedures should provide clear and easy-to-access security measures that are standard to follow throughout daily tasks
  - Technology -- Technology choices such as firewalls, password reqs, VPN usage, etc, directly impacts security of information 

Data Types: 
  - Public -- Anyone can access, redistribute
  - Confidential -- Any data protected from unauthorized access
    - Proprietary -- Company owned/generated; ex: trade secrets, R&D, etc
    - Private -- Data about a person and their private life
      - PII -- Personally identifiable information; bdays, ID #'s, financial/health/education history
      - PHI -- Protected health information; diagnoses, test results, etc -- Also includes PII on file
This data, when unprotected, can lead to Financial, Operational, and Reputational damages.
To protect data by good measure, companies can refer to widely recognize standards such as GAPP -- Generally Accepted Privacy Principles.

The CIA Triad; a general cybersecurity checklist for data security:
  - Confidentiality -- Limiting access to private data
  - Integrity -- Ensuring that data isn't modified/destroyed in transit; sender and receiver see the same data
  - Availability -- Limiting downtime, keeping data accessible throughout necessary hours

Data exists in 3 states:
  - At rest, in motion, in use
  - DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Systems help to prevent/detect data loss

DLP System Types:
  - File-level DLP -- identifies sensitive files; these files can be accompanied by secure policies; ex: some files may have a no email policy
    - The DLP embeds these attributes into sensitive file's metadata; this way the attributes stay with the files as moved/copied
  - Network DLP -- Monitors all data transfers on a network for privacy/sevurity violations; can even prevent file downloads
  - Cloud DLP -- Extension of Network DLP; Detects/Encrypts sensitive data before it is stored in the cloud
  - Endpoint DLP -- Monitors all endpoint devices for data loss and leakage 

Encryption:
  - Turning human readible plaintext into an encrypted ciphertext form
Symmetric encryption -- single private key for both encryption/decryption; can be vulnerable to attacks through key interception; AES
Asymmetric encryption -- Involves public/private key pair; slower than symmetric but more secure; RSA
